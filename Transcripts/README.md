ICFP Presentation Transcripts
---

ICFP'22 talks were transcribed by professional captioners to provide
closed captions. Now, as talks get published on YouTube, we are adding
these captions to YouTube videos from
[this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp4ee6ZAtFD9XMD2EZ02K9xK)
playlist. Real-time captioning is not always 100% accurate, and there
may be errors, especially around special terms. If you want to help
with accurate close-captioning of ICFP talks , you can help with
reviewing transcripts and sending us corrections.

The transcripts are stored in this git repository and organized by the
weekday the talk was given. Ignore the “raw” folder. You can edit a
talk’s transcript and submit us corrections via pull request. YouTube
will try to synchronise it with talk audio, so the transcript has to
stay close to what was said during the presentation.
