>> Can everybody hear me all right. Okay, good afternoon, everybody.
>> We'll begin with the student competition awards, and programming language achievement award will be presented with a short talk. And then we'll talk about the... we'll announce the most influential paper award from 10 years ago and end with ACM best paper. And let's start with student competition awards.
And invite to the stage.
>> So, hello, everybody, you hear me.
>> Okay, so as you might have noticed. So first of all, I'm Danel Ahman. And Daniel is the other co-chair, and organize the student research competition, as you might have notice the last few days great student have shown poster and is given presentation, and today honor the best three. In the under grad category and graduate category. And so we're going to start with under graduate category, and want to say in person you get the little gift from the organizers here. And after wards ACM will send you monetary award, medal, and I believe 1 year complimentary membership, and so this is what you get afterwards, so under graduate category, start with third place, 2nd place, 1st place, and if the student is here, come to the stage and give a little gift, reward. So third place in the category goes to Francis Rinaldi. Are you here.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
Okay, the second place in the under graduate category goes to Hilbert Chen Yanjun Chen and Eric Zhao [APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
>> And the first place in the under graduate category goes to Bernard Boey.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
>> So now let's continue with the graduate category. So here the third place goes to Denis Carnier.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Second place goes to Nathan Corbyn.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
>> And finally the 1st place award goes to Arthur Correnson.
[APPLAUSE]
>> So these are all the awards but before I finish I really like to thank all the participants we had. And all the members did very diligent work reviewing the abstracts the student had to submit, and lots of good feedback, and the members from the ICFP audience that helped with judging the poster and presentations, so thanks to all of you.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Thanks. So at this time we'll have a visitor I guess from Airmeet land, Jeff Foster to speak to you about SIGPLAN.
>> Didn't see that.
[Laughter]
>> I didn't do that, everyone.
[Laughter]
So.
>> There is Jeff. I can't hear you yet. Let's see if we can get the audio going. You can't hear me.
>> Oh, we have delay, maybe.
>> Have delay...
>> Okay, you are good.
>> Can you hear me okay.
>> Yes.
>> JEFF: All right, good, and can you see me or MOT?
Can you only hear me or see me as well.
[Laughter] >> nice shirt Jeff.
[Laughter]
>> All right... sorry... okay, I can hear myself in the video, so I'll talk and not worry about sharing my screen, so hi, everyone, I'm Jeff Foster of SIGPLAN, and keep short because of technical glitches.
So what is SIGPLAN, the special interest group on programme languages, and probably already know that, oversees, ICFP, PLDi... and we are the 4th largest Sig at ECM with under 2,000 members, and the mission is to promote awareness and advancement of research and practice of programming languages and SIGPLAN run entirely by volunteers. So SIGPLAN is us. And we're SIGPLAN, if you are interested in getting involved in SIGPLAN, please don't hesitate, please get in touch, would love to have your help. Would love to give you two high level updates, and one to tell you about our finances, we spend money on student travel, summer school, and conference management, and infrastructure, and SIGPLAN blogs and awards, and so on, and want to let you know we're doing fine, despite the challenges of COVID and all the craziness that happened, our conferences are very well run as ICFP is very well run and comfortable reserves, thanks to many years of good management from prior executive committee so everything is fine in SIGPLAN land. Which is good. As you know in-person conferences are back, because you are there most of you. Sorry I couldn't be there. I love in-person conferences and wish I could have made it. Do expect further experimentation with remote participation. Because we're still figuring out how to get that to work in the best possible way.
Couple other notes, I just wanted to -- heads up conferences are expensive to run, and inflation is running rampant worldwide and do expect registration rates will tick up in the future to cover that, don't be surprised when that happens. Want to encourage everyone to have your institution join ACM open. ACM open is the new ACM solution to open access publication. And it's the replacement for the digital library subscription.
So your institution if it joins ACM open will have access to the digital library, and will prepay for open access based on average number of papers the institution publishes.
So essentially ACM is going open access, this is the way they're going to do it and still exist.
Because they need to have income to make this work.
And we have programming languages people at institutions all across the world.
And so you can go to the folks who subscribe to the ACM digital library in your institution and tell them about ACM open and encourage them to join, and doing a big service to ACM community, and told the... T folks about them and she joined, it's not hard to do. And heads up ACM has new system for keeping track of people that violate ACM policies.
So there is a data base that ACM has called ACM violations data bait. Don't worry, you're not in it. Don't be panicked.
The only way people are in it, they will know, because you will get a letter from ACM saying you are there.
And so if someone violates a policy, and sanction, it will be recorded in data base. And will be checking the data base when we ask for volunteer and is committee members, and so on.
So hopefully this doesn't affect anyone listening to this.
I just wanted to make you aware that it is there, and new effort by ACM.
So, that's it for me. If you have any comments, suggestion, complaints, questions about SIGPLAN, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Love to hear from you. Thanks everyone.
[APPLAUSE]
>> So at this time it's my distinct pleasure to unveil the...
[Laughter] >> the first award, the first award after the SRC, the SIGPLAN programming languages achievement award.
And the winner is my distinct pleasure to invite to the stage.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Thank you very much. To receive the award. Looking at the list of previous recipients see the founding fathers of Computer Science, and see many of my mentors scientist, and papers and books and electric Lectures and influence in my early years, and means a lot to me to be added to the list.
Especially happy to receive the awardd ICFP, so many familiar faces and realized that I've always been doing functional programming of one kind or another. I talk about both kinds. Not always dominant kind see at ICFP but never mind. --
I've always been fascinated by the act of programming since my first encounter with apple 2 computer age of 13. My programmes never worked, I could write a story in broken English, and the computer could understand it, and run it tirelessly, without complaining ever, very quickly, and also fascinated by the languages and what it takes to implement them.
I had this feeling that implementing even a basic interpreter was instantly harder than a game of pong which was about the extent of my skills at that time.
So as a hobbyist and later a student learned a few languages.
And then 1988 I discovered ML.
One of my professors was working on the first OCaml, .. looking as good as pascal without the stay tuned limitations and really see myself using this language, with everything I was interested in that time, computing, and systems programming also. And so at that time I had heard about pure functional programming. That was late 80's, so Haskell didn't exist.
So it looked like traditional British education, cold showers, and -- not something that helped me do what I wanted to do. So at that time, late 80's, implementations of ml were actually pretty bad. So, my classmates I mean.
And so new implementation of Caml, Caml light. And is finishwas highly portable to turn on PCs and Macs of the 90s, which was seriously under power. And so it was disabled in education, and for self discovery and helped a lot I think popularizing functional programming, especially in the French university system. Then it was covered done a couple of times, who a native code compiler, which features and became the basis for OCaml that we have today. And did my HhD postdoc and early career bstract types and presentation independence properties, how to combine data collection with Module systems and then that brought me to language based security, to some extent instance what makes programs more secure, and not just the saferr. I still don't have an answer to this question. And then got interested in java and virtual machine, and byte code verification problem. And .
And really formal verification proof systems. And... I wanted to verify, and wanted assurance, and then realized from colleagues that it was inductive data type. And there were good facilities to work with that.
And later I also did mechanization of type systems, mostly for fun. That kind of thing that became popular a few years later. Revelation came 2004. From the work of...
verifying the... that implements finite sets of AVL-balanced trees.
So what they did was transcribe the code to Coq, and functional KREKness and balancing properties, and extract back, and it was almost the same. To me it was a discovery you can use Coq as a programming language. And I would say hyper pure functional programming language, as opposed to Haskell-style. Nearly pure, functionall programming, and in -- functional programming --
so in exchange you get function and objects of the logic, and so you don't even know programme logic. Your code is already part of... and that was an eye-opener to me, and thought about C compiler with this methodology, that we can specify and verify with the old compilers and that was an idea, and by M in 72. One of the first mechanized proofs.
And then in the 90's, we did verified compilers, to abstract machines, and some of that mechanized in the early 2000s.
And industry need for verify C compiler as I heard PR it people in the industry.
And how hard can that be?
It turned out to be very hard.
Unfortunately I didn't know about number of side projects attempted to do something before. So it was tough. But in the end it worked. And that gave the concert verified compiler, and you know something can be done, it feels less difficult already. So I think inspired others, with compilers and code generator, and analyzers verification tools, and compiler verification, and... I know I'm getting all the submissions to review [Laughter] >> and back to that methodology of hyper pure programming. Where this plus monad, for all effects including nontermation, it's how you --
built around this idea.
And but you can still use...
logics, and it's a tribute to tremendous power of type theory, we can do all that.
And I still like effectively programming. And still like to go back to OCaml. And as KC mentioned this morning in his talk, and the EFSHTH effects handler, and even more effects if you want, but principle effects and modular programming as well. And looking forward to the new possibilities this opens. And in closing, thanks to all who worked with me.
Ph.D. students, OCaml development team, and thanks to if youer listening. And thanks again, to the committee.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
THAFRJTS to you Xavier.
Thanks to you Xavier. At this time, we'll be unveiling the most influential paper for ICFP, and to do so we'll be visited by Tony H.
>> Greetings. I'm coming to you from down under in Australia so about 1:30 in the morning my time. Would have been wonderedful have been with you in Slovenia but unfortunately not to be at this point in time.
My pleasure to present this award. The award for the most influential paper of ICFP of 10 years hence, so that's from 2012, the important thing to realize about this award it is a SIGPLAN award. Each of the four flag ship conferences of SIGPLAN have most influential paper award. Which is determined by committee comprising the general chairs and programme chairs of the committee from the 10 years previous, and the general chair and programme chairs of the committee from the previous year. So this would have been 2021 for this year. So, the committee comes together and they consider the papers that were presented 10 years previously. And they determine the winner which receive an award of 1,000 dollars to be split among the authors of the winning paper and judgment here is influence of the paper that stood the test of time. So this year's committee ...
It's my great pleasure to say the winner of the most influential paper award for 10 years ago, 2012 ICFP is...
addressing Covert termination and timing channels in concurrent information flow systems.
Deian Stefan Alejandro Russo Pablo Buira is Amit Levys and John Mitchell and David Mazieres. It has received attention in the general security community beyond the usual range of icfp papers.
There are several follow-up papers that build on the insights, and extend the results to more general settings. It presents a dynamic information control system that eliminates termination and internal timing covert channels, while mitigating external timing or without relying on cooperative scheduling. It achieves this by running potentially sensitive actions in separate threads The system is implemented as a Haskell library using labeled concurrency primitives and demonstrated an example server side web application framework.
I'm trusted client client applications sharing a persistent key value store showing how the library addresses potential timing and termination leaks. I believe we have one of the authors present at ICFP in person on behalf of the others. And I know some of the others are also watching this presentation now. . I believe Alejandro is going to come up to receive the award.
[APPLAUSE]
>> All right, thank you very much everyone, thanks to Tony and speaking on behalf of my coauthors we're all grateful for the recognition, and thanks to the ACM committee for that. Let me tell you something about the paper that perhaps maybe only the coauthors know about this.
This paper was already special for all of us. And now more special, but let me tell you why. We submit the paper, and it comes rebuttal, there was some things to clarify, and things to argue for. We did it, we thought, we did a pretty good job and send it. And then we were expecting positively either conditional accept or accept.
Can you guess with a we get?
None of them. We got conditional reject [Laughter] >> what does that mean, we were all confused. It means like do we need to change it until we're finally rejected?
[Laughter].
>> Anyway. So after we figured out what it means, it means the same as condition accept, but in a different way, please dot changes otherwise reject. Which sends a strong message, and motivated right.
And so by then, we really appreciate the rebuttal face.
It really helped us out in 2012.
And now standing here receiving the award and now even more convinced about that.
[Laughter] >> so on a personal note, I would like to thank all the community because this committee was one of the Mohrs communities in my personal career to become a scientist, when I was back in Argentina with no access to functional programme research, and thank you, to ACM SIGPLAN, and everyone for this recognition, super grateful and honoureded for that. Thank you very much.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
>> At this time presenting the ACM Europe best paper award aka ICFP distinguished paper awards. So the best paper award is that for outstanding technical contributions to ACM conferences, taking place in Europe.
Recognition of contribution to the area, and the winners were selected by the conference program committee and the each paper will receive -- each author receive a certificate, and the authors of the paper will receive 1000 euro to be split among the authors.
>> Okay, so our first award that I'll hand out is for normalization for Fitch-style, authors...
[APPLAUSE]
>> Sorry about that.
[Laughter]
[APPLAUSE]
Our second paper is programme adverb B s and Yao Li, and Stephanie [APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Our third ACM Europe best paper award, goes to multitypes and reasonable space by Beniamino Accattoli, Ugo Dal Lago, and Gabriele Vanoni.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
And last but not least we have to disentangle the awards:
Entanglement detection with near zero cost: Sam Westrick, Jatin Arora, and Umut Acar.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
Now it's time for our Chairs report for this years... [off mic]
[Laughter] our 35 year old.
>> Of course. Until.
>> Okay, thank you. Hi.
>> Hi.
[Laughter] >> hi, Simon. You?
[Laughter]
>> Okay.
So the report have to thank Adam, because I took the slides from him, I actually inherited from Ron who got the slide from Adam, so thanks Adam. So the timeline was very similar to previous years. And I tried to avoid as much as possible deadlines during the weekend.
[Applause]
[Laughter]
[Applause]
And it was good the conference was later, so the reviewers had more time reviewing the papers.
We had 7 weeks instead of 5 weeks last year. And we had the guardian reviews due after 3 weeks, and then we had additional 4 weeks.
And we had conditional acceptance, and people had four weeks to review the papers and didn't have conditional, but maybe the next PC chair, that's a good conditional reject.
And final notification, and paper due.
Then, our issue is online, you can access, it's open-access, and the journal has been used since 2017.
Okay, so we're 102 submissions.
And 7 papers were unconditionally accepted. Of course we had suggestions but those were not... the acceptance were not based on the suggestions. 28 were conditionally accepted. And at the end all the conditionally accepted papers were accepted, so ended up with 35 papers. 29 research papers and 3 experience reports and 3 functional pearls reviews 5-9 reviews per PC member. We had some issues like... everybody else during the review period.
So we had to excuse some people from the PC from higher loads, so everybody was contributing to share reviews that other PC members couldn't do, and we had three reviews per paper at least. Many papers even had 5 reviews.
And every paper except 1 had an expert review.
So I really put a lot of effort trying to at least one expert review per paper.
And the only paper that doesn'tor didn't that have, all the members, the reviewers thought that it was okay. It was -- the expertise was enough.
Even though didn't have an X in the reviews.
The decision process was entirely online, and we discusseddiscussed, and in some cases done Zoom meeting with few people, with few reviewers, but didn't have Zoom meeting with entire PC. And higher standard applied to PC papers. So no objection for acceptance.
Needed to be expressed. We had one guardian assigned per paper.
The guardian had to provide review after 3 weeks, and that was helpful, because it gave me the... by the review, I could see if really the person was an expert or not. And that give me enough time to find enoughreviewer who was an expert.
In addition to guardian, we had discussion lead. The person that was trying to get discussion going after response period, and then also have the concept of a shepherd. There was the one that making sure to talk with the others expressing which condition we wanted.
Most papers -- were the same person, and sometimes didn't work like that. And work paper the guardian was different from the lead discussion and the shepherd was different.
Okay, so PC got bigger. 2020, 17 members, and 202130 members, and 202242 members. So who knows what next year will be.
This is amazing group of people of the PC, everybody worked very hard. I think the reviews were very good. It wasn't just a paragraph each review going into details.
And in addition we have external reviewers, those who are contacted in case not satisfied with the guardian review, and so 20 members, additional members, and thanks to all those. And we also had junior researchers that helped in writing reviews. PC member was responsible to the review, they didn't just give away to somebody else, but still had help from all these people.
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Yep, okay, did you read it.
Submission rate in the past 3 years has been the same, 33%, 34, 35%.
So that's preCOVID, right, was higher. And this year was 34%.
Author, of course US, France was less than last year. Ahh, exactly! Japan was higher.
Right, and UK beat France.
[Laughter] >> you can not have it all...
>> [Off mic].
>> Of course.
[Laughter]
And this graph is the same as last year, or maybe I copied the one from last year, no, no, I'm kidding, most papers have 3 authors, but we also have a paper with 10 authors, and 7 authors. Topics similar to previous years. We had more papers on effects this year.
Less paper on logic, last year was particular year, number of papers on logic was higher. But otherwise, it seems that it's the same graph as last year.
The programme, as you have seen, included 4 journal paper.
General functional programming paper. And so 4 papers opt in and we accepted all 4 of them.
To celebrate the 41st ICFP anniversary we included the chat with Arvind and Guy Steele.
Important to have session --
right?
To talk about what happened in the past, and originally wanted to invite Jack Dennis because he turned 90 and wasn't possible.
But for young people probably do not know before ICFP was called FPCA which stands for functional programme and computer actechurecomputer architecture, and wanted to invite to explain why computer architecture tied with functional programming. And hoping tradition to continue, in the future to have reflective moments. Okay. Artifact evaluation committee led by Gabriel and Janni, and 26 applications and 26 were accepted.
This is the evaluation committee.
The virtualization committee.
We can not thank them enough.
Anja...
[APPLAUSE]
Both, Anja and Apoorv.
Excellent, couldn't do a better job than what they did.
Unbelievable and very nice to talk to and collaborate with.
Always available, extremely nice people.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Please.
>> [APPLAUSE]
Steering Committee. I have to thank Adam, and Ron. They're the cochairs of this year because you can not imagine how much I am bothering them. Every day, practically every day Ron I asked you things and Adam too.
So they never send me to hell -- I don't know, really, there was a moment where Ron didn't reply to my emails. But then, he started sabbatical and I said ooh, and then reply to my previous emails, thank you. You have done it, you are part of the chair this year ICFP, as far as I'm concerned, thank you.
[APPLAUSE] and the list is also Stephanie, her too you send an email and in an hour you get an answer, thanks Stephanie...
And everybody helped the steering committee to prepare the programme committee. And GAI gave me good suggestions everybody. And the journal people, Phil Wadler editor.
Beginning was involved, crafting the paper. And Dirk and Simone amazing too. Very nice to work with them, really helped. And JFP coeditor Jeremy and Derek Dreyer. Thanks to them.
[APPLAUSE]
>> In general should thank all the amazing organizing committee. They just did an excellent, excellent job, I would say.
And in particular I want to thank Andrej.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE] very nice to work with him, in the beginning a little bit worried, having something run by Italian Slovenian a little bit concerned, but things were okay.
Really nice to collaborate with you.
Okay, I am done?
[APPLAUSE] NSH [APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Zena before you go. Stand here. We know how much you love attention. Zena for many years has been the heart of the functional programme committee through running OPLSS, and very significant in my own growth, I visited you as a graduate student and brought me into your home, and you have been there for me for years.
>> I don't have sun glasses if I cry.
>> Have to catch you by surprise. So from me and the rest of the community I think we should give Zena a big hand of applause.
[APPLAUSE]
>> With that from one PC chair to another PC chair to yet another PC chair, pass to Sam L, talk about ICFP 2023.
>> The general chair would maybe normally be making announcements, but unfortunately he couldn't be here this year.
But I will start . So the next year ICFP is going to be in Seattle, and I don't know what these places are. But he can probably tell you more about them. There is Olympic sculpture park, I have been there actually.
And the venue, the green dot in the middle, which is... I can't remember the name of the hotel, I thought it would be named on here, West End Seattle, and highlighted Seattle art museum, and quite famous music venues, and lots of things to do in Seattle, and great place, I'm sure it will be a lot of fun, I'm the PC chair and assembled a PC. Now PC stands for pack of cards. So... assigned a card to each PC member. And actually seeing the numbers Zena was showing, 30, 2 years ago, 42 this year and about 54 the following year, so we're going up in increments of 12.
Some point we'll probably have to stop.
But, I had the pleasure of sort of shadowing Zena this year, which was extremely helpful, and a bit intimidating to see all the things she had to cope with.
And yeah, I would really like to thank her for giving me that opportunity, and I had another point in there and forgotten what it was. Anyway, I should highlight that... someone else had to be a joker there, and Sam has the same name as me. So I picked him.
[Laughter]
>> If you prefer pictures here are all the people.
I think that's all I have to say, but please submit your papers next year.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Zena, didn't think you had the last word did you.
>> Did you ever see that clip of John Cleese acceptance speech at Oscars, you should see it, to conclude this meeting, I would just like to quickly say a couple of words, but please don't clap preemptivly, already clapped for some of these people, but I would like to just emphasize the point that this is a community effort. And I just wanted to make that clear. But first there, our venue and our caterer, I think, I hope you think doing a fine job. We don't have to clap for them now because they're not here. If you do think they did a good job, let them know. And as Zena was already showing the numbers and the people, ICFP organized by number of people, and many more that are not accounted for here, and too many for me to list, but the numbers should make it clear that this really is a community. This it a large number of people that put together the meeting.
And I think now we should clap because we haven't still clapped for some of them.... So...
[APPLAUSE]
>> So you could say these are the organs of ICFP, but who are the blood cells?
It's the student volunteers [APPLAUSE]
>> Please stand up all the student volunteers, stand up.
[APPLAUSE]
>> I do hope the virtual student volunteers also stood up wherever they are.
There are lots of cliches I could use at this point, but want to make a very heart felt thanks to those who really stood by me and entirely impossible to organize this meeting without their help. And I would actually like to, the following people to come up here to the stage, and see all the others, they got boxes of chocolates they don't know what's in them.
Now these 4, are going to come up here, please. That's you Zena, YE, YE. Yes yes.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
I couldn't even make a presents for them without them knowing.
So the only thing I could do was to lie. So one of them knows what the present is, but she thinks it's for another person.
[Laughter]
Another one is going to guess what the present is as soon as I take out the box, and I'm hoping that two of them are clueless.
So thank you very much Zena, Neringa Anja and Katja couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
So you may be remember how I lied, Katja I was going to the charger for my camera, I had to get something.
[Laughter]
That's just one of the lies.
>> Thank you. It's heavy. You should show people what you got.
Who knows what it is. .
[Laughter]
[APPLAUSE]
>> I don't know if the camera can show this, but it's a 3D-engraved sign that says ICFP from one direction, and lamda from another direction [ooohing].
>> They will show it to you for a fee.
[Laughter]
[APPLAUSE]
>> This concludes the ICFP conference, thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
