* Instructions

Real-time captioning for ICFP will be provided by human captioners. To
ensure that your talk is captioned correctly it is important to
provide a list of any uncommon words and technical terms that will be
used in your talk ahead of time, as well as the pronunciation of these
terms --- this will allow the captioners to prepare ahead of time and
add the terms to their personal dictionary, ensuring that they can
quickly and accurately caption your talk.

** What words should we include?

A good rule of thumb would be anything that the average person
wouldn't know about and anything that spell-check wouldn't know by default:

- Names of author's and anybody who will be cited
- Names of tools
- Names of programming languages
- Technical terminology

The captioners are skilled professionals, but may not be aware of
terms in our field, and may mishear them unless given context ahead of
time.

** How do we contribute?

Each talk should have a directory, and within that directory there is a CSV file. The CSV file has the following format:

The *most* important fields are the term and pronunciation columns, but
providing some example uses and context can also be helpful for
understanding how the term might be used, and you can leave any other
notes you have about the term in the notes column.

For pronunciation feel free to use IPA, or whatever works for you for
conveying pronunciation.

The tags column is also optional, but adding some tags about the usage
of the term can help us organize a larger glossary to provide
captioners for future conferences.

** What else can I do?

Uploading your slides / paper into your directory can also be
helpful. This will give captioners access to your talk and they can
have a backup copy to follow along to, and we may skim through the
talks ahead of time for any extra keywords that might be worth adding.
